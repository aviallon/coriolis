 //! \enum        FunctionFlag
 //!              A set of flags to that can be passed to functions/methods througout
 //!              all Katabatic.

 //! \var         KbOpenSession
 //!              Tells the function to open it's own Session, otherwise use
 //!              the one that should already have been opened.

 //! \var         KbRealignate
 //!              On AutoSegment axis manipulation, force the realignment of all
 //!              the segment on an aligned set, even is the axis of the canonical
 //!              is already at the right coordinate.

 //! \var         KbNativeConstraints
 //!              Ignore user-defined constraints or terminal induced ones (for AutoContacts
 //!              anchored on terminals) and return the owning GCell alone.

 //! \var         KbForceMove
 //!              Tells the function to force move, even if it is not needed.

 //! \var         KbHorizontal
 //!              Request some action to be done in the horizontal direction.

 //! \var         KbVertical
 //!              Request some action to be done in the vertical direction.

 //! \var         KbWithPerpands
 //!              Request that AutoSegments in perpandicular direction should be includeds.

 //! \var         KbSource
 //!              Request AutoSegments anchored by their source anchor or that some
 //!              operation has to be performed on the source.

 //! \var         KbTarget
 //!              Request AutoSegments anchored by their target anchor or that some
 //!              operation has to be performed on the target.

 //! \var         KbWarnOnError
 //!              Display a warning if something has gone wrong.

 //! \var         KbPropagate
 //!              The action will affect all the segments on an aligned set.

 //! \var         KbUseAboveLayer
 //!              Request/tell the a above layer has been used.

 //! \var         KbUseBelowLayer
 //!              Request/tell the a below layer has been used.

 //! \var         KbDoglegOnLeft
 //!              The dogleg has occured on the left <em>of something</em>

 //! \var         KbDoglegOnRight
 //!              The dogleg has occured on the right <em>of something</em>

 //! \var         KbHalfSlacken
 //!              For AutoSegment::slacken(), change the overconstrained limit
 //!              from 10 tracks down to 3 (hard-wired).
