\subsection{Detailed Description}
This class describes a \mbox{\hyperlink{class_device}{Device}}.

A device is a leaf instance which means its model is not defined in a external file but is described inside the device. As an instance, the \mbox{\hyperlink{class_device}{Device}} inherits all \mbox{\hyperlink{class_instance}{Instance}} methods and adds specific properties\+: mos type, bulk connection and list of internal transistors.

\begin{DoxyNote}{Note}
Althought today \mbox{\hyperlink{class_device}{Device}} object only consider Transistor\+Family devices, it will have to consider other devices, such as Capacitor when C\+H\+A\+MS project will.
