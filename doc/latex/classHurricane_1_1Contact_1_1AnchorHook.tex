\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
With contacts, a new type of \mbox{\hyperlink{classHurricane_1_1Hook}{Hook}} appears \+: the {\bfseries{\mbox{\hyperlink{classHurricane_1_1Contact_1_1AnchorHook}{Anchor\+Hook}}}}, which allows to attach a contact upon an other component, on which it is said to be \char`\"{}anchored\char`\"{}. It becomes then a \char`\"{}relative contact\char`\"{} with respect of the coordinates of this component. The \mbox{\hyperlink{classHurricane_1_1Contact_1_1AnchorHook}{Anchor\+Hook}} is always a slave hook.

\begin{DoxyRemark}{Remarks}
A contact has two attributes {\ttfamily $<$Dx$>$} and {\ttfamily $<$Dy$>$} which represent the relative coordinates of the contact with respect to the coordinates of the component on which it is anchored (through this \mbox{\hyperlink{classHurricane_1_1Contact_1_1AnchorHook}{Anchor\+Hook}}). When it is not anchored, those coordinates becomes relative to the origin of the cell, which means they are absolute.
