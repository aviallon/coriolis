.SH "Detailed Description"
.PP 
Route two matched capacitors, C1 and C2, drawn in a capacitor matrix\&. 

Connections are put in place with reference to a given matching scheme\&. Elementary capacitor units are connected to horizontal and vertical routing tracks that represent top plates and bottom plates nets of C1 and C2\&. Supported types of capacitors are Poly-Poly and Metal-Metal\&. Technologycal rules are provided by 350 nm AMS CMOS technology with three-four metal layers\&. Metal layers that are used for routeing are placed similarly to horziontal-vertical (HV) symbolic Alliance CAD tool router, where horizontal metal channels are drawn in metal 2 and the vertical ones are in metal 3\&. Given a matrix of dimensions $ R*C $, the total number of vertical tracks is $ 2C+2 $ equivalent to $ C+1 $ couples, ensuring that every elementary capacitor is positioned between four vertical tracks, two from each side\&. In fact, every adjacent couple of these tracks represent top plates and bottom plates of C1 or C2 as shown in Figure 1\&.
.PP
Layout
.PP
An elementary capacitor unit can be a part of C1 or C2 according to the matching scheme\&. However, to respect common-centroid layout specifications, for C1 and C2 to be equal, the matrix number of colums and number of rows must be both even\&. Addionnally, the number of elementary capacitors dedicated to C1 must be equal to those dedicated to C2\&. These two conditions are tested in one of the class methods\&. An exception is raised if at least one of the two is not respected\&.

.SS "def drawVRoutingTracks ( self,  vRoutingTracksLayer)"

.PP
Iteratively draws vertical routing tracks given the physical layer \fCvRoutingTracksLayer\fP\&. Every elementary capacitor is consequently positioned between four routing tracks, two from each side\&. Each couple of adjacent routeing tracks represent top plate and bottom plate nets of Ci, where i is in [1,2]\&. As given in Figure 2, capacitor $ C_{ij} $ with an even j value situated in even columns have and inversely for odd columns numbers\&.
