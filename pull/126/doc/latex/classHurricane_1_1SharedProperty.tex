Shared properties can be attached to many objects of the data base.

When a new property is created, it is not yet assigned to any particular object. It becomes effectively the property of an object after the call {\bfseries{dbo-\/$>$Put(property)}}. The property then receives a message {\bfseries{On\+Captured\+By}} whose argument is the additional owner. From that time onwards, this object becomes partially responsible of the future of the property.

{\bfseries{What can happen then ?}}

If the property is destroyed \+: The property being shared, it informs its owners of its deletion. Each of those owners detaches it from the list of its properties. If the object is a quark and that property is the last one it owns, it automatically deletes itself.

If a property of same name already exist \+: Two properties with the same name can\textquotesingle{}t cohabit, the older one is released by the object which receives the message {\bfseries{On\+Released\+By}} from that old property and proceeds as required according to the type of property.

If the property is attached to a new owner \+: Being shared, the property is simply captured by this new owner.

If one of the owners of the property is destroyed \+: The properties captured by this object are then released. The future of those properties is here completely managed by the different messages {\bfseries{On\+Released\+By}} which are associated to them. If the deleted object is the last owner of a shared property, this one is automatically deleted.
