Private properties are owned by only one data base object.

When a new property is created, it is not yet assigned to any particular object. It becomes effectively the property of an object after the call {\bfseries{dbo-\/$>$put(property)}}. The property then receives a message {\bfseries{on\+Captured\+By}} whose argument is the additional owner. From that time onwards, this object becomes partially responsible of the future of the property.

{\bfseries{What can happen then ?}}

If the property is destroyed \+: The property, being private, informs its owner (if any) of its deletion which detaches it from its property list (if the object is a quark and if this was the last property owned, it has no more reason to exist and automatically deletes itself).

If a property of same name already exist \+: Two properties with the same name can\textquotesingle{}t cohabit, the older one is released by the object which receives the message {\bfseries{on\+Released\+By}} from that old property and proceeds as required according to the type of property.

If the property changes of owner \+: This one is first captured by the new owner and the released by the older owner (the reason why messages are called upon in this order will be explained later).

If the property owner is destroyed \+: All properties owned by the object are then released. The future of each of those properties is fully driven by their respective messages {\bfseries{on\+Released\+By}}.

The property has an owner, this one is informed of the property deletion and detaches it from its property list. If the object is a quark and if this was the last property owned it automatically deletes itself.

\begin{DoxyRemark}{Remarks}
Once the property is attached to an object this one becomes responsible of its automatic destruction. When a property changes its owner, the old owner delegates this task to the new one. On the other hand, a property which has never been attached to an owner will never be deleted automatically.
\end{DoxyRemark}
{\bfseries{Returns\+:}} the current owner of the property (or NULL if at not been assigned yet).
